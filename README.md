# URL Checker App

Created a very simple browser application in Javascript that allows a user to check if an entered URL exists using the power of React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting started

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the local server (this project Vite)
